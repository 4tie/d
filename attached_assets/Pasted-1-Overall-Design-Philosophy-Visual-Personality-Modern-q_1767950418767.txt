1. Overall Design Philosophy
Visual Personality

Modern, quiet, professional

Dark-first theme (quantitative tools read better in low contrast)

Subtle color semantics:

Green = improvement / positive delta

Red = regression / risk

Yellow = caution / trade-off

No decorative noise

No “crypto casino” aesthetics

Mental Model

The UI should feel like:

A strategy lab

A flight cockpit, not a game

A code-aware analytics tool, not a trading terminal
